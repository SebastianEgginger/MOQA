# A Rigorous Quantum Framework for Inequality-Constrained and Multi-Objective Binary Optimization

This repository contains the numerical studies presented in the paper. It also provides functions for integrating the Multi-Objective Quantum Approximation (MOQA) framework with existing methods for finding ground states of Ising Hamiltonians. Specifically, it includes all steps from problem formulation to the determination of the coefficients for each term in the Hamiltonian.
The file MOQA.ipynb will guide you through all functions.
